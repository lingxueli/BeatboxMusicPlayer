# BeatboxMusicPlayer

This is my project using Java Swing, GUI, I/O, networking and threads to build a beatbox application. 

The application implements multiplayer network system with I/O techniques that is able to send and receive beat patterns, along with messages among users. 

It supports features of creating sound patterns across 16 beats made of 16 instruments using MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface). 

Try it on your machine. So much fun.:0)
